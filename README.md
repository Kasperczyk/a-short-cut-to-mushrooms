# Description
A blog I built for my wife as a birthday present.
I used the [Trophy](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/trophy-jekyll) theme by Thomas Vaeth.

The initial content was copied from her old (and really ugly :-)) blogspot blog.

For the actual blog, visit https://kasperczyk.github.io/a-short-cut-to-mushrooms/.
I might move it to a "real" domain some time in the future.

Other problems / things I might fix / do (or have my wife do if it affects the content, not the tech) in the future:
- captions on picures
- shorter posts
- improved profile card
- more carefully picked post images (I just picked the first I liked for each post...)
- fix category pages (currently not working on the hosted site - dunno why)
- update / improve / change categories
- make "Umlaute" (üäö) work in post titles / links
- make "back" link scroll with the content
- check the mobile versions for bugs and possible improvements
- make images fit better on one viewport
- ...
